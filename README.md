### Building from Source

>**NOTE**(tso): This is for **64-bit windows-only**.
It might compile on other systems if you set `GOOS` and `GOARCH`
but it won't run. I have not tested it in wine or on ReactOS or any version of
Windows other than 7SP1.

```
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com
cd !:2
git clone git@github.com:dayvonjersen/chopsuey
cd chopsuey
go get github.com/lxn/walk
go get github.com/fluffle/goirc
go get github.com/akavel/rsrc
go get github.com/maruel/panicparse/cmd/pp
go get github.com/kr/pretty
make icon
make
```

If that doesn't work [tell me about it](mailto:tso@teknik.io?Subject=it%20doesnt%20work).
